1) How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Testing may seem like the simple solution for ensuring code is functional and secure, but it requires setting aside my ego and pride, and looking at my code through a lens that I've done something wrong, not that I've done something right or perfect. The focus should be on verifying that the code functions as intended and doesn’t do anything unintended. This is why independent testing teams are often valued. Another key aspect of testing is making sure it’s done consistently. Integrate tests into the CI pipelines so they run automatically as part of the process to prevent broken builds. If a test fails, don’t ignore it, review and fix the issue, rather than disabling the test.

2) How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs can be challenging to grasp because the user may not always know what they want or may struggle to communicate it clearly. During elicitation, the 5 Whys technique can be particularly helpful in digging deeper into the core needs. Another effective approach is to observe a user interact with the software to be replaced and ask what they like and dislike, or why they do things a certain way. Finally, creating mock-ups for the end user can help identify potential issues early, preventing major mistakes in the final software delivery.

3) How do I approach designing software?

I approach the person requesting the software with a sense of endless curiosity, which is key in helping them communicate their vision clearly. Often, the client doesn't have a complete picture from the start, and the elicitation process can encourage them to explore their vision more deeply. For me, elicitation is the most critical step in gathering requirements, as it sets the foundation for everything that follows. Missing a requirement early, only gets more difficult to fix/add as the project goes on.
